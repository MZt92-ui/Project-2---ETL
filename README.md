# Project-2---ETL
Monash DA Bootcamp
Group 2 - Maozhu Tang, James Le, Steven Bouios

Topic = Australian Tourism.
We decided on Australian Tourism because we all miss travelling!

The objective of our project was to identify data that we could use to extract relevant information and  transform it into datasets that could be analysed professionally.

We have put all our resources and necessary files in folders and have included our final report and findings.
